            13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in Godâ€™s
            sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared
            righteous. 14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by
            nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves,
            even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the
            requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their
            consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes
            accusing them and at other times even defending them.)

            This text in Romans is trying to tell us that, not only those who
            know God and follow His law will be considered righteous. Quite the
            opposite actually, Paul is telling us that, there is a lot of people
            that don't know about God but deep within them they end up following
            what the law says, because it's in their nature, kinda like having a
            moral compass or something similar to that. Therefore, those who do
            not know about God and His law, still can follow a right path
            because their hearts created a law for themselves. And if this law
            is similar to God's law, that shows everyone that not only their
            hearts are pure, but also the deep of their conscience.
