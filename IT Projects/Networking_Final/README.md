# Networking Final Project â€“ Enterprise Network Simulation

This project is a comprehensive enterprise network simulation built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** as the final for a computer networking course. It includes routing, switching, VLAN segmentation, DHCP, NAT, ACLs, server deployment, and network security measures.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

- `Final Test Again.pkt` â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file
- `Computer Networking Final Documentation.pdf` â€“ Full project report
- `IP Addressing Table.pdf` â€“ Complete subnetting and IP schema
- `Final Network Diagram.pdf` â€“ Logical layout of the entire network

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- **3 Routers**, **3 L3 Switches**, and **7 L2 Switches**
- **Multiple VLANs** across Admin, HR, Finance, Sales, R&D, Support, Voice, Server Room
- **RIP v2** dynamic routing
- **DHCP Relay** via ip helper-address
- **NAT/PAT** to the cloud
- **ACLs** for SSH restriction, server isolation, and VLAN-level filtering
- **SSH & Wi-Fi** configuration
- **VoIP** partially configured (working demo submitted separately)

## âœ… Key Functional Tests

- âœ… Admin VLAN can SSH into routers
- âœ… Internet access limited to Admin & R&D VLANs
- âœ… Inter-VLAN control and access restrictions working
- âœ… DHCP working across most VLANs (static IP workaround used in HR due to Packet Tracer bug)

## ðŸ“· Visuals

See `Final Network Diagram.pdf` for a full topology and VLAN layout.

### ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Open `Final Test Again.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2+)
2. Wait for boot-up and test:
   - Inter-VLAN routing (`ping`)
   - NAT translation (`show ip nat translations`)
   - DHCP assignments
   - ACL enforcement (`ping` and `traceroute`)
3. Refer to the PDF documentation for configurations, IP plan, and ACLs
